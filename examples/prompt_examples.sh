echo "OLD APPROACH (Removed):"
echo "- Direct MCP server management"
echo "- Hardcoded API calls"  
echo "- Complex error handling"
echo "- Server lifecycle management"
echo ""

echo "NEW PROMPT-BASED APPROACH:"
echo "- Natural language instructions to Claude CLI"
echo "- Claude internally uses MCP tools"
echo "- Human-readable responses"
echo "- Zero server management"
echo ""

echo "PROMPT EXAMPLES:"
echo ""
echo "Jira Query Prompt:"
echo "'Get this week's Jira work items for all users in projects TIM, PROJ - Use Jira MCP tools to retrieve information. Please provide a summary of tickets, their status, assignees, and any blockers.'"
echo ""

echo "Slack Message Prompt:"  
echo "'Send a message to Slack channel #engineering with content: \"Daily standup in 5 minutes!\" - Use Slack MCP tools. Confirm the message was sent successfully.'"

echo "Team Status Collection Prompt:"

echo "‚ú® All external service interactions now use natural language prompts!"
echo "‚ú® Claude CLI handles MCP tool orchestration automatically!"
